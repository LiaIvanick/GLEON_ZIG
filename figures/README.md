# Figures

Each data cleaning script should write high-level qc-check figures to a subfolder here, with one subfolder for each dataset. This figures could include boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, and others. See the README in the [figures folder](figures/README.md) and the [scripts folder](scripts/README.md) for more information and suggested qc checks.
